        <h1 class="headerWork">The Project</h1>
        <p>For this project we were tasked to do a 30 second animated short using only typography as the main source of the animation.
            This makes it harder as you have to think outside the box at times to have the words directly reflect what they words
            are trying to say. Trying to make a play on words was challenging and fun. I had a lot of fun doing this project. It
            doesn't hurt that I was able to choose one of my all time favorite comedians to do this for, Mitch Hedberg.</p>

        <h1 class="headerWork">The Storyboards</h1>
        <p>Storyboards are crucial for any planning. Much like wireframes in UX Design, the storyboards give you a sense of direction
            and how the project is going to be laid out. It allows you to do the animation in a way that is more organized and more
            effective. Without them the project would be a lot harder to navigate through. The storyboards allow you to figure out
            ahead of time all the assets that are needed so nothing (or most everything) is not forgotten. You can continue to polish
            the project the more you dive in to it to make the higher fidelity portion of the animtypography
